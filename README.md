## Project: Meta-Object-Detection: Few-Shot Learning and Domain Adaptation for Object Detection Using Meta-Learning Techniques.

### Dataset preparation (PASCAL VOC)
This GitHub contains the data preprocessing of the PASCAL VOC dataset. The process involves the making standard data frame for object detection (eg: Image-path: xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, label)

### Step 1: Organize The Dataset

Before creating a data frame, I make sure the PASCAL VOC dataset is organized. Typically, the dataset contains two main folders: one for images and another for annotations (XML files).

### Step 2: Parse XML Annotations

I parse the XML annotation files to extract information about bounding boxes and labels for each image. I use the xml.etree.ElementTree library to do this.

### Step 3: Iterate Through the Dataset

Iterate through the dataset, parsing the XML annotation files, and storing the information in a list or dictionary. I create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an image with its details.

### Step 4: Create a Pandas DataFrame

Now that I have collected the data in a list or dictionary, I create a Pandas DataFrame for further processing and analysis:

### Images with bounding box

Finally, I display some images with bounding box.
